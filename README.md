We report on a cross-sectional investigation using a work-phase framework and multi-site composite skin sampling (Figure 1) to interrogate the skin microbiome, resistome, and mobilome of swine workers during a typical work shift that includes showering as a biosecurity intervention. We observed a significant increase in bacterial DNA load on worker skin during the workday shift, with concurrent changes in the composition and abundance of specific microbial taxa, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that could harbor ARGs. We further observed that compulsory showering at the end of the workday reverted the skin microbiome and resistome to a baseline state, however the worker mobilome remained enriched with numerous key mobile genetic elements of public health significance. These results suggest that occupational work in swine facilities can significantly impact workersâ€™ skin microbiomes, but that these impacts may be transient if biosecurity interventions are implemented. The relevance of these findings for short- and long-term swine worker health requires further study. However, the observation that showering may dampen daily microbiome impacts has important public health implications, as it demonstrates that biosecurity protocols could be leveraged to minimize microbial transmission from farms to general communities.
